In many underserved communities young people have limited exposure to technology
They have probably  heard of AI and are aware of what it is  but they often don’t understand its capabilities or how it can support their learning
Access to academic resources is also a major barrier as most are online(require internet access), in English(assume English fluency) and they assume  high digital fluency


We are building this chatbot to bridge this gap by delivering engaging, language inclusive, and offline first learning through WhatsApp and mobile app
This is so no one gets left behind in this evolving digital world
Our chatbot is meant to bring AI-powered digital literacy, academic support, and online safety(online scams are becoming big)  accessible to everyone....especially those who need it most
[23:12, 21/05/2025] Luna❤️: The best thing about this is inclusivity.

Many individuals in underserved communities are left behind due to language and connectivity barriers
We're bridging that gap

In South Africa, only like 40% of households have reliable internet access
And most of the available online educational content is predominantly in English, making it less accessible to non English speakers

The chatbot is designed to overcome these challenges
No one should be excluded from digital education due to language or connectivity limitations
[23:19, 21/05/2025] Luna❤️: I really believe this chatbot is just the beginning
There are so many real problems we can help solve with it..

Areas like mental health, academic support, life skills, and career guidance....
Too many young people are being left behind due to language, connectivity, and access barriers
[23:25, 21/05/2025] Luna❤️: There are already platforms like this that exist but what’s special about our approach is our offline first design that makes sure that people with limited or intermittent internet access can still fully engage with the chatbot
Second....we prioritize language inclusivity by delivering content in native languages to overcome language barriers
And lastly, leveraging WhatsApp....a platform already widely used in these communities and everyone is familiar with it
