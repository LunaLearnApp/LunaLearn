## 🧠 AI Prompt: Upgrade My Learning App

> **Act as a full-stack developer and UI/UX designer.**
> Enhance my **existing web-based learning app** to turn it into a **fully interactive, AI-powered educational platform** like [Buddy.ai](https://buddy.ai/en/). Keep the current structure but improve and extend it with the following features:

### ✅ Functional Enhancements

1. **Grade-Based Learning**

   * Add a grade selection system for Grades 1–12.
   * Each grade unlocks tailored subjects and lessons.
   * Design it as a card grid (Buddy.ai style).

2. **AI Bot Tutors**

   * Integrate with **OpenAI GPT API** for smart conversations.
   * Each bot should have:

     * A personality
     * A subject focus (e.g. Math Bot, Reading Bot)
     * Visual avatar and name
   * Enable multi-turn conversations with memory of past messages.

3. **Voice Interaction**

   * Add **speech-to-text** using the **Web Speech API** or **Whisper**.
   * Add **text-to-speech** using **ElevenLabs** or **AWS Polly** for natural bot voices.
   * Add a "Mic" button so users can speak and listen.

4. **Multilingual Support**

   * Allow switching between multiple languages (e.g. English, Zulu, Xhosa).
   * Use **Google Translate API** or **open-source multilingual models**.
   * Make sure both UI and bot replies adapt to the selected language.

5. **Gamified Progress**

   * Track progress: scores, badges, streaks.
   * Award XP for completed lessons.
   * Display reward animations like Buddy.ai.

6. **Buddy.ai-Style UI/UX**

   * Keep it playful, colorful, and kid-friendly.
   * Follow the look and feel of Buddy.ai with:

     * Rounded buttons and avatars
     * Large fonts and soft colors
     * Animated transitions (use Framer Motion)
   * Add illustrations or animations for feedback

* **Node.js + Express** (API/backend)
* **PostgreSQL or Firebase** (user progress)
* **OpenAI API** (chatbot)
* **ElevenLabs** (voice)
* **Google Translate API** (language switching)

### 📦 Additional Requirements

* Keep all current code intact where possible.
* Modularize new components (e.g. `<GradeSelector />`, `<VoiceChatBot />`).
* Make it mobile-friendly.
* Include a parent dashboard to track student progress (optional).
